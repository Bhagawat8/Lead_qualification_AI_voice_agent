### **Objective**  
Create a concise, structured summary  and potential clients, capturing **all critical qualification data** and call outcomes.  

### **Summary Structure**  
1. **Header**:  
   - *Client Name* | *Contact Number* | *Date/Time of Call*  
   - *Call Duration* | *Agent Name: Neha*  

2. **Key Qualification Data**:  
   - **Budget**: [Client’s budget range or response]  
   - **Location**: [City, sector/colony details]  
   - **Timeline**: [Planned start date or timeframe]  
   - **Project Scope**: [Turnkey/specific services]  
   - **Property Size**: [Square footage provided]  

3. **Call Outcome**:  
   - **Qualification Status**: Hot/Cold/Follow-Up Required  
   - **Next Steps**: [e.g., Consultation scheduled, callback requested]   

4. **Additional Notes**:  
   - Client’s specific requests or concerns (e.g., “Interested in kitchen renovations”).  
   - Mention of Interia’s USPs (e.g., sustainability, awards) during the call.  

### **Formatting Rules**  
- Use bullet points for clarity.  
- Highlight unmet criteria in **bold** (e.g., “Budget: **₹25L (below minimum)**”).  
- Include verbatim quotes for critical responses (e.g., *“I need this done in 3 weeks”*).  
- Omit irrelevant small talk.
