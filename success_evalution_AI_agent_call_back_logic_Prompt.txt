**Prompt:**

Analyze the call transcript using the following criteria:  
- **Budget**: Is it >= ₹30L?  
- **Location details**: Are specific details provided (e.g., sector, colony, city)?  
- **Timeline**: Is it immediate or later?  
- **Project scope**: Is it defined as turnkey or select?  
- **Property size**: Is it mentioned?  

Based on the transcript, categorize the call into one of the following lead types:  
- **Hot Lead**: The call fully meets all criteria (budget >= ₹30L, specific location details, clear timeline, defined project scope, and property size mentioned) and the client is ready to proceed.  
- **Warm Lead**: The call shows ambiguous interest, meeting some criteria but not all, or the client is not fully committed.  
- **Cold Lead**: The call does not meet the criteria (e.g., budget < ₹30L, vague location details, unclear timeline, undefined scope, or property size not mentioned).  
- **Special Case**: The call involves issues such as unanswered calls, callback requests, identity issues, or abusive language requiring special handling.
